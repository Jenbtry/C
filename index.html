  <p>If you'll listen my darling, tonight 'ere you rest.</p>
<p>I'll tell you the story your daddy* loves best
How a marvelous thing that all children should know
Happened in Bethlehem, long, long ago.</p>
<p>There were stars in the heavens, all shining and bright
And a new star was rising o'er Judah that night.</p>
<P>For within a poor stable a baby was born
And that beautiful baby was Jesus our Lord.</P>
<p>It's a story of wonder and glory and awe
Filled with heavenly love and the goodness of God
Learn it well, take it with you wherever you go.</p>
<p>
  The most beautiful story that's ever been told
  Though the folk in the village were all fast asleep.
</p>
<p>
  There were shepherds out watching that night with their sheep
  When a legion of angels came down from on high
  Singing and bringing great tidings of joy.
</p>
<p>
  It's a story of wonder and glory and awe
  Filled with heavenly love and the goodness of God
  Learn it well, take it with you wherever you go.
</p>
<p>
  The most beautiful story that's ever been told
  In a manger he lay as the angels had said
  While Mary and Joseph kept watch by his bed.
</p>
<p>
  For the babe was our Savior, the Father's own Son
  Sent to love little children and bless everyone.
</p>
<p>
  It's a beautiful story, the sweetest I've heard
  Full of comfort and hope, and it's true--every word
  So remember it always, and then when you're grown.
</p>
<p>
  Tell this sweet story to babes of your own
  It's a story of wonder and glory and awe
  Filled with heavenly love and the goodness of God.
</p>
<p>
  Learn it well, take it with you wherever you go
  The most beautiful story that's ever been told.</p>
